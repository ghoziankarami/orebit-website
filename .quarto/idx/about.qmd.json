As a **Senior Geologist & Geospatial Specialist** and **Certified BNSP Competent Person (CP)**, I've not only evaluated and signed off on mineral resource estimation documents but also lived through the frustrations of expensive, inflexible proprietary software that often creates more barriers than solutions.\n\nMy academic foundation includes a **Master of Science in Geological Sciences** from King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) and a Bachelor's degree in Geology from Universitas Padjadjaran. But more importantly, my expertise has been forged in the field—from analyzing drillhole data in remote offshore environments to developing quality control protocols that ensure reliable resource estimates.\n\n## The Open-Source Catalyst\n\nWhat drives me is a fundamental belief: **every geoscientist should have access to powerful, transparent analytical tools—regardless of budget constraints or geographical location.** Too many talented professionals in smaller companies, consulting practices, or developing regions are held back by software licensing costs that can exceed $50,000 annually.\n\nThis conviction led me to become an active advocate for open-source solutions in geology. I've mastered the R ecosystem (`tidyverse`, `sf`, `tmap`, `gstat`) not just as an alternative to proprietary software, but as a superior approach that offers transparency, reproducibility, and unlimited customization potential.\n\n## Technical Expertise That Delivers Results\n\n**Core Competencies:**\n- **Geostatistics & Resource Modeling:** Advanced variogram modeling, kriging techniques, and uncertainty quantification\n- **Data Science Integration:** R programming, statistical analysis, and machine learning applications in geology\n- **Quality Assurance Systems:** SOP development for exploration and grade control workflows\n- **Geospatial Analysis:** GIS integration, spatial interpolation, and 3D geological modeling\n\n**Professional Certifications:**\n- **Competent Person (CP)** - BNSP Certified for Resource Estimation (authorized to evaluate and sign off on mineral resource documents)\n- **Senior Geologist** - Indonesian Geologist Association (PERHAPI)\n- **Advanced Geostatistics & Resource Modeling** - Multiple international certifications\n\n**Software Proficiency:**\n- **Traditional Tools:** Micromine, Net-Promine, SGEMS\n- **Open-Source Mastery:** R ecosystem, Python for geological applications, QGIS\n- **Development Platforms:** R Shiny, web application development, database management\n\n## The Vision in Action\n\nMy current focus centers on **GeoDataViz**—an open-source R Shiny application that embodies everything I believe about democratizing geological analysis. This isn't just another software project; it's a proof-of-concept that demonstrates how practitioner-built tools can deliver enterprise-level capabilities while remaining completely accessible and transparent.\n\nGeoDataViz represents the first tangible step toward my larger vision: **establishing open and transparent tools as the standard for every professional to unlock the full potential of their data.**\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThe geological community faces unprecedented challenges—declining ore grades, increased environmental scrutiny, and growing demands for transparency in resource reporting. Meeting these challenges requires not just better technology, but fundamentally different approaches to how we analyze, validate, and communicate our findings.\n\nBy providing **practical, practitioner-built workflows and expert guidance**, I'm enabling geoscientists and mining engineers to confidently transform complex geological data into reliable, actionable intelligence. This isn't about replacing established methods—it's about enhancing them with modern data science techniques that any professional can access and modify.\n\n## The Broader Impact\n\nThrough this platform, I'm building more than just software—I'm fostering a community where geological knowledge is shared openly, where analytical methods are transparent and reproducible, and where innovation comes from practitioners solving real-world problems.\n\nEvery blog post, every line of code, and every tutorial serves the ultimate goal: **catalyzing a data-driven transformation in geoscience** where open-source solutions become the foundation for more accurate, reliable, and accessible geological analysis.\n\n---\n\n*Ready to join this transformation?
