Here are some key projects that showcase my expertise in geological data analysis and application development.

### GeoDataViz: R Shiny Application

**GeoDataViz** is an open-source *workbench* for geological data visualization, analysis, and validation, specifically designed for drillhole data. This project aims to promote R-based solutions for everyday geological tasks.

-   **Technology Stack:** R, R Shiny, `tidyverse`, `sf`, `ggplot2`, `plotly`
-   **Key Features:** Interactive 3D visualization, statistical analysis, and comprehensive QA/QC data validation.
-   **Impact:** Democratizing access to advanced geological data analysis tools

**Project Highlights:**
- Full-featured local version with comprehensive drillhole analysis
- Live web demo for easy access and testing
- Integration with popular R geological packages
- Future Pro version planned with automated reporting and resource estimation

### PT Aega Prima Resource Evaluation

As **Competent Person (CP)**, I participated in the evaluation and signing of resource and reserve documents for PT Aega Prima, ensuring compliance with national reporting standards and industry best practices.

**Responsibilities:**
- Resource model validation and QA/QC
- Geostatistical analysis and variogram modeling  
- Compliance review according to KCMI standards
- Technical report preparation and documentation

### Grade Control Dashboard Development

Designed and developed interactive training modules and dashboards for grade control and quality control processes, aimed at improving field accuracy and operational efficiency.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Interactive R Shiny dashboards for real-time monitoring
- Automated data validation and flagging systems
- Statistical process control charts and alerts
- Mobile-responsive design for field operations

### Offshore Tin Exploration Projects

Led multiple offshore tin exploration projects involving advanced geostatistical modeling and resource estimation.

**Key Achievements:**
- Implemented advanced sampling strategies for marine environments
- Developed custom geostatistical models for placer deposits
- Integrated geophysical and geological data for improved resource confidence
- Established QA/QC protocols for offshore drilling programs

### Open-Source Geological Tools
