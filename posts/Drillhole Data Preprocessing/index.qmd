## Introduction

After completing exploratory data analysis (EDA), the next critical step is data preprocessingâ€”transforming your raw drillhole data into a format suitable for resource estimation. This process significantly impacts the quality and reliability of your final resource model.

GeoDataViz provides advanced tools for data preprocessing, from automated compositing to sophisticated domain analysis. This guide covers essential preprocessing techniques that will prepare your data for accurate resource estimation.

## The Preprocessing Pipeline

Data preprocessing in geological contexts involves several key steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Validation**
2. **Geological Domain Definition**
3. **Sample Compositing**
4. **Outlier Treatment**
5. **Data Transformation**
6. **Statistical Validation**

Let's explore each step using GeoDataViz capabilities.

## 1. Data Cleaning and Validation

### Automated Data Quality Checks

GeoDataViz performs comprehensive quality checks that identify:

**Sample Interval Issues:**
- Overlapping intervals that create double-counting
- Gaps in sampling that require handling strategies
- Inconsistent sample lengths that affect estimation

**Coordinate System Problems:**
- Inconsistent coordinate references between holes
- Elevation discrepancies that affect 3D modeling
- Survey closure errors that impact hole positioning

**Assay Data Quality:**
- Below detection limit values requiring substitution
- Missing assays that need interpolation or flagging
- Duplicate samples for precision assessment

### Data Conditioning Strategies

**Missing Data Handling:**
```
- Geological interpolation for short gaps
- Statistical imputation using nearby samples
- Flagging of extensive missing intervals
- Alternative sampling strategies for future programs
```

**Detection Limit Treatment:**
```
- Half detection limit substitution
- Distributional approaches using fitted distributions
- Conditional simulation for realistic value ranges
- Impact assessment on resource estimates
```

## 2. Geological Domain Definition
