## The Foundation of Reliable Resource Estimation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) represents the critical foundation upon which all reliable geological analysis is built. After over a decade of resource evaluation projects and having signed off on mineral resource estimates as a **Certified Competent Person**, I can state unequivocally: **inadequate EDA is the primary cause of flawed resource models and costly mining decisions.**

This comprehensive guide presents the systematic EDA methodology I've developed through real-world mining projects, now implemented in GeoDataViz to provide every geoscientist with access to professional-grade analytical capabilities.

## Why Professional EDA Matters: Lessons from the Field

In my experience evaluating offshore tin exploration projects and conducting resource assessments for major mining companies, I've encountered numerous cases where inadequate EDA led to serious consequences:

- **Resource overestimation** of 25% due to unrecognized spatial bias in drilling patterns
- **Geological domain misclassification** resulting in inappropriate estimation parameters
- **Grade distribution assumptions** that ignored critical high-grade populations
- **Data quality issues** that propagated through entire resource models

These aren't abstract risks—they're real challenges that cost millions in misallocated capital and operational inefficiencies.

## The GeoDataViz EDA Framework

GeoDataViz implements a comprehensive EDA framework specifically designed for geological datasets, addressing the unique challenges of spatially distributed, geometrically complex drillhole data.

### **Phase 1: Data Integrity Assessment**

Before any analysis begins, GeoDataViz performs exhaustive data validation that goes far beyond simple format checking:

**Spatial Validation:**
- Coordinate system consistency across all drillholes
- Survey data validation using closure error analysis
- Collar position verification against survey control
- Desurveying accuracy assessment for deviated holes

**Geological Consistency Checks:**
- Lithological code validation against established dictionaries
- Structural measurement consistency (azimuth/dip relationships)
- Alteration intensity scoring validation
- Geological contact relationship verification

**Assay Data Validation:**
- Detection limit handling for trace elements
- Analytical precision assessment through duplicate analysis
- Batch effect identification using analytical sequence data
- Standard reference material performance evaluation

The application doesn't just identify issues—it provides specific recommendations for resolution and quantifies the potential impact on subsequent analysis.

### **Phase 2: Statistical Population Analysis**

Understanding grade populations is fundamental to appropriate modeling decisions:

**Univariate Analysis:**
GeoDataViz provides sophisticated tools for examining individual element distributions:

- **Advanced distribution fitting** using multiple theoretical distributions (log-normal, gamma, Weibull)
- **Population mixture analysis** to identify distinct grade populations
- **Outlier identification** using multiple statistical methods with geological context
- **Transformation assessment** to optimize data for geostatistical analysis

**Key Insights for Practice:**
When I analyze grade distributions, I'm not just looking at statistical parameters—I'm identifying geological processes. A bimodal distribution might indicate two distinct mineralization events. Extreme skewness could suggest supergene enrichment. These insights directly inform domain definition and estimation strategies.

**Multivariate Relationships:**
Understanding element associations reveals critical geological processes:

- **Correlation matrix analysis** with statistical significance testing
- **Principal component analysis** to identify underlying geological controls
- **Cluster analysis** for natural population identification
- **Geochemical ratio analysis** for process understanding

### **Phase 3: Spatial Pattern Recognition**

Geological data is inherently spatial, and GeoDataViz provides comprehensive tools for spatial analysis:

**Drillhole Coverage Assessment:**
- **Spatial density analysis** identifying over-sampled and under-sampled areas
- **Directional bias identification** in drilling patterns
- **Coverage uniformity evaluation** for different geological domains
- **Sampling adequacy assessment** for reliable resource estimation

**3D Geological Visualization:**
The interactive 3D visualization capabilities allow for:

- **Dynamic drillhole trace examination** with real-time grade coloring
- **Cross-sectional analysis** along user-defined orientations

**Spatial Continuity Preliminary Analysis:**
Before formal variogram modeling:

- **Directional grade trend analysis** to identify anisotropy
- **Contact analysis** between geological domains
- **Structural control assessment** on mineralization distribution
- **Scale of continuity estimation** for different elements and domains

### **Phase 4: Geological Domain Intelligence**

Professional resource estimation requires geologically sensible domain boundaries:

**Statistical Domain Validation:**
- **Grade distribution comparison** between proposed domains using formal statistical tests
- **Contact sharpness analysis** to distinguish hard from soft boundaries
- **Transitional zone characterization** for gradational contacts
- **Domain boundary optimization** using grade continuity metrics

**Advanced Domain Analysis:**
- **Multivariate discriminant analysis** for domain boundary refinement
- **Machine learning clustering** for natural population identification
- **Structural geology integration** with statistical domain analysis
- **Alteration intensity correlation** with grade distribution patterns

This analysis provides objective justification for geological domain boundaries—essential for professional resource reporting standards.

### **Phase 5: Data Quality Intelligence**

Understanding data quality is crucial for appropriate estimation parameter selection:

**Sample Support Analysis:**
- **Sample length distribution** evaluation by geological domain
- **Recovery assessment** and its correlation with grade
- **Core quality evaluation** impact on assay reliability
- **Drilling method influence** on data quality and spatial bias

**QA/QC Performance Evaluation:**

## Advanced EDA Techniques in Professional Practice

### **Composite Length Optimization Analysis**

One of the most critical decisions in resource estimation is composite length selection. GeoDataViz provides sophisticated tools for this analysis:
