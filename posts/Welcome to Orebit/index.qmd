## Professional Geological Analysis, Accessible to Everyone

**Orbit Geological Solutions** develops open-source R Shiny applications that transform geological data analysis. Our mission: provide enterprise-level analytical tools without expensive licensing fees.

### The Challenge

Traditional geological software costs $20,000+ annually, creating barriers for:
- Small exploration companies
- Independent consultants
- Geologists in developing regions
- Educational institutions

### Our Solution: Three Integrated Products

#### 1. GeoDataViz (Available Now)
**Complete geological data analysis platform**

- Interactive 3D drillhole visualization
- Advanced statistical analysis & EDA
- Comprehensive QA/QC validation
- Professional reporting tools

## Quick Start with R

Orbit applications are built with R. Here's a simple example of geological data visualization:

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

# Sample drillhole data
collar_data <- tibble(
  HoleID = paste0("DH", 1:20),
  X = runif(20, 100, 500),
  Y = runif(20, 100, 500),
  Z = runif(20, 50, 200),
  Grade = rlnorm(20, 0, 0.5)
)

# Interactive 3D visualization
plot_ly(collar_data, x = ~X, y = ~Y, z = ~Z, 
        color = ~Grade, type = 'scatter3d', mode = 'markers',
        marker = list(size = 8, colorscale = 'Viridis'),
        text = ~paste("Hole:", HoleID, "<br>Grade:", round(Grade, 2))) %>%
  layout(title = "Drillhole Collar Map",
         scene = list(
           xaxis = list(title = "Easting"),
           yaxis = list(title = "Northing"),
           zaxis = list(title = "Elevation")
         ))
```
